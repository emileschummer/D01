Calculations:

-> Create vector fields from data for each time step, keep track of the angle for each time step
    -> This should be done for the three propeller configurations

-> Obtain time averaged fields 

-> Obtain phase averaged fields
    -> Match every timestep to a blade angle
    -> Define the bin sizes
    -> Average over the each bin

-> Calculate parameters for fields
    -> Vorticity
    -> Mean-velocity fluctuations
    -> Turbulent kinetic energy
    -> Etc.

-> Calculations for the 3 planes and 3 configurations: 9 cases total



Objectives/Results:

    -> Compare the three propeller configurations. Emphasis on prop on vs off.
        -> How does the BL look with prop off condition
        -> How does vorticity and other parameters' distribution change in the field between configurations
        -> Can we spot any phenomena? Separation and reatachment, changes in mean velocities, other.

    -> Compare the time averaged and the phase averaged fields
        -> Same comparisons as in propeller configurations
